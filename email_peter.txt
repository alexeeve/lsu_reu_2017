Herschel is going to work on the HDF5 output and python analysis tools
while Evgueni decided to work on the Lorenz gauge code (set up
constraint satisfying iniital data to check the code for correct
quasinormal mode frequencies and tails if possible).

For Evgueni, I have attached the current state of the code in a gzipped
tarball. Ed McClain did some work on the problem before leaving. There
is a Mathematica notebook in the directory with his attempt at deriving
the constraint satisfying initial data. Until I get back, Evgenui can
try to relate the code (which is a bit of a mess, I'm afraid) with the
equations from the paper and maybe try to look at Ed's mathematica
notebook in order to get an idea about what Ed was doing.
